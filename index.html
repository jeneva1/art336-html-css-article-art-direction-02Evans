                        <p>Audrey Kawasaki is a Los Angeles-based painter, known for her distinctive, erotically charged portrayals of young, adolescent women. Her works are oil paintings painted directly onto wood panels, and her style has been described as a fusion of Art Nouveau and Japanese manga.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Kawasaki studied fine art painting for two years at the Pratt Institute in New York City, but left after two years without completing her degree. She has reported that several of her professors suggested that she should stay away from her particular style of painting nudes. She cites the emphasis in the New York art scene on conceptual art, an approach at odds with her figurative, illustrative style, as among the reasons she left.</p>

                <p>Audrey creates her art by using graphite and oil paint directly on raw wood. The wood grain typically shows through and she is able to create a very unique effect with this technique.</p>

                <p>Audrey landed the cover for the January 2012 issue of Juxtapoz, her second time being featured in that publication. Juxtapoz launched with the mission of connecting modern genres like psychedelic and hot rod art, graffiti, street art, and illustration, to the context of broader more historically recognized genres of art like Pop, assemblage, old master painting, and conceptual art. Although based in San Francisco, Juxtapoz was founded upon the belief in the virtues of Southern California pop culture and the freedom from the conventions of the "established" New York art world.</p>
